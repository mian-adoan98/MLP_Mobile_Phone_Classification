# Project Scope for Mobile Classification Problem:

## Global Need for Mobile Classification Model

Mobile Image classification is a most profound machine learning models tha enables companies and business to classify latest updated mobile phones that are supplied in the marketplace. The main task of this system is to retrieve all the latest smartphones, such as IPhones, Samsungs, OnePlus, Motora, Nokia and any other phones to classify based on its properties, which is their brand as our target for this project. 

Mobile image classification is a powerful machine learning model that enables companies and businesses to classify the latest mobile phones available in the marketplace. This technology leverages advanced algorithms to analyze images and accurately identify various smartphone brands and models.

The primary objective of this system is to retrieve all the newest smartphones—such as iPhones, Samsungs, OnePlus, Motorolas, Nokias, and others—and classify them based on its company's brand. In continuation of the project, the company's brand will be used to create a catalogue of all newest smartphones found on web. 

By implementing mobile image classification, businesses can streamline inventory management, enhance customer experiences, and improve marketing strategies. For instance, retailers can quickly categorize their stock, while consumers can easily identify products through visual recognition, ultimately driving sales and customer satisfaction.

Moreover, as the mobile phone market continually evolves, having an automated classification system allows companies to stay updated with the latest trends and ensure that they meet consumer demands efficiently. This project not only aims to develop a robust classification model but also seeks to explore innovative ways to integrate this technology into real-world applications.

- **Problem statement**
    
    Retail companies in the electronics sector receive thousands of new smartphones in their inventory but face significant challenges in maintaining efficient inventory management and optimizing stock levels and pricing. This influx of devices often leads to an overwhelming number of unidentified models, making it difficult to classify them based on their specifications. As a result, these challenges negatively impact the companies’ overall business performance in inventory management.
    
- **Objectives**
    
    This project aims to classify unknown mobile phones based on their specifications, focusing specifically on the manufacturers (labeled as brands) from which these smartphones are produced and tested. We will develop a machine learning model utilizing computer vision technology that learns from mobile phone images sourced from the website [orange.nl](http://orange.nl/). The model will analyze these images to identify patterns and categorize them into multiple brand classifications for the smartphones.
    
    Concisely:
    
    - building an image classification model to classify mobile images based on its brands
    - determine the task performance of the mobile phone classifier model
    - deploy the model into a web application to optimize inventory management
